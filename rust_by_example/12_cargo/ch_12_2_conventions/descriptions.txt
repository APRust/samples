Suppose that we wanted to have two binaries in the same project, though. What then?

It turns out that cargo supports this. The default binary name is main, 
as we saw before, but you can add additional binaries by placing them in a bin/ directory:

foo
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    ├── main.rs
    └── bin
        └── my_other_bin.rs

To tell cargo to only compile or run this binary, 
we just pass cargo the --bin my_other_bin flag, where my_other_bin is the name 
of the binary we want to work with.

For run/build and etc. for addition bin:
'cargo run --bin my_other_bin'


For standard running with command 'cargo run':

[package]
default-run = "NAME_OF_BIN_CRATE"

Example:
...
[package]
 name = "ch_12_2_conventions"
 version = "0.1.0"
 edition = "2021"
 default-run = "ch_12_2_conventions" // or name any bin crate
...
